        // 1. For Gson: While java-sdk-common does need Gson in order to work, the
        // LaunchDarkly SDKs that use java-sdk-common have different strategies for packaging
        // Gson. The Android SDK exposes it as a regular dependency; the Java server-side SDK
        // embeds and shades Gson and does not expose it as a dependency. So we are leaving
        // it up to the SDK to provide Gson in some way.
        //
        // 2. For Jackson: The SDKs do not use, require, or embed Jackson; we provide the
        // LDJackson class as a convenience for applications that do use Jackson, and it is
        // only usable if the application already has Jackson in its classpath. So we do not
        // want Jackson to show up as a transitive dependency.
