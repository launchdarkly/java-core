## Build instructions
 
### Prerequisites
 
The project builds with [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) and should be built against Java 8.
 
### Building

To build the project without running any tests:
```
./gradlew jar
```

If you wish to clean your working directory between builds, you can clean it by running:
```
./gradlew clean
```

If you wish to use your generated SDK artifact by another Maven/Gradle project such as [java-server-sdk](https://github.com/launchdarkly/java-server-sdk), you will likely want to publish the artifact to your local Maven repository so that your other project can access it.
```
./gradlew publishToMavenLocal
```

### Testing
 
To build the project and run all unit tests:
```
./gradlew test
```
